# Prediction of Malignant Melanoma

## Aim
This work involves the automated prediction of skin cancer and its types using two stage Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN). The first stage of CNN extracts low level features and second stage extracts high level 
features. Feature selection is done using these two CNN and ABCD (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Colour 
variation, and Diameter) technique. The features extracted from the two CNNs are fused with ABCD features and 
fed into classifiers for the final prediction. The classifiers employed in this work include ensemble learning 
methods such as gradient boosting and XG boost, as well as machine learning classifiers like decision trees and 
logistic regression.
